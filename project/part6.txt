Error will be visible in ECB and CBC. These will be mostly recovered, as
there is only a minor change to one block. In these two encryption
schemes, you can see a small disturbance to the image at one spot. With
the CTR, since the plaintext isn't getting passed through the encryption
algorithm, but rather XOR'ed with the encrypted counter, the error is
not visible, as it is just the brightness of one color of one pixel that
is affected.
